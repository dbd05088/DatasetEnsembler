CLIP_START_DOCSTRING = r"""
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`CLIPConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

        input_ids (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`):
            Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default should you provide
            it.

            Indices can be obtained using [`AutoTokenizer`]. See [`PreTrainedTokenizer.encode`] and

            Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

            - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
